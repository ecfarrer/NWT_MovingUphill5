#Order of running files:
#DataCleaning.R: to clean microbe and plant data
#SuccessionalStagePCA.R: to incorporate biogeochemistry and do a PCA for successional stage
#boral: doing a little more data reorganizing, calculating clr, running hirarchical models, graphing networks
#Randomizations.R: 


#Loading/saving/packages needed

#if vetor memory exhausted happens do this in terminal
cd ~
touch .Renviron #create this file if it doesn't already exist
open .Renviron
#then write this in the file that opens, need to play with this to see what crashes R. 700 was too much. 70 on my laptop seems to work ok, maybe a little too much but didn't crash, 70 did crash on my laptop, trying 35 on laptop (now trying 40 since on loading envronmnts I got th error), 70 on imac seems good
